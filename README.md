# HOUSE-PRICE-PREDICTOR
This Repository contains a simple House Price Predictor which has been constructed using Machine Learning -> Linear Regression. 

Housing Price.csv is the initial data file which has been transformed into Transformed Housing Data.csv through certain preprocessing techniques.
The Data preprocessing.ipynb file contains the preprocessing steps. Then the model is trained and tested using Linear regression which is present in Linear Regression Model.ipynb. The model is around 85% accurate and can predict the House price.
